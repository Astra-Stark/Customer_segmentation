# Customer Segmentation Using RFM Analysis with ML Models

## Overview

This GitHub repository contains code and resources for a project focused on customer segmentation using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis with machine learning models. The project aims to identify distinct customer segments based on their transactional behavior using the RFM framework and then apply machine learning models for more advanced segmentation.
